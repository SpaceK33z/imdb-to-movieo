# IMDb to Movieo

This simple Chrome extension adds a button on IMDb movie pages to [**Movieo**](https://movieo.me).

I grew tired of navigating to Movieo, searching for the same movie I had open in IMDb, and then closing the IMDb tab. This extension intends to fix that.

Movieo is a very nice movie discovering website.
